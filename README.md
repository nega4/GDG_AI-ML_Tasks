# Machine Learning Weekly Practice

## Overview
This repository tracks my weekly practice sessions in Machine Learning. The goal is to gradually build practical skills by working on different tasks and projects.

## What it Will generally include:
- Implemented Linear Regression on simple datasets.
- Explored Logistic Regression for binary classification tasks.
- Continue practicing ML concepts and models on structured datasets.
- Learn and apply preprocessing, feature handling, and evaluation techniques.
- Gradually tackle more advanced models and real-world datasets.
- Document results, visualizations, and insights for each session.

## Objective
To build a strong foundation in Machine Learning through weekly hands-on practice and gradual exposure to more complex concepts and tasks.
